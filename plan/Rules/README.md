# Recouvra+ Project Rules

This folder contains rules and guidelines that any AI agent (or developer) must follow when continuing work on this project. These rules ensure consistency across all commits regardless of who (or which AI) is writing the code.

## Files

- `coding-style.md` — Code formatting, commenting, and documentation rules
- `git-workflow.md` — Commit messages, branch strategy, and push process
- `architecture.md` — Project structure, patterns, and conventions used

## Context

- Steps 1–4 are done (Adem's commits: setup, models, JWT middleware, auth controller)
- Steps 5–14 remain (mix of Baha and Adem commits)
- Check each `plan/step-XX-*.md` file for exact instructions per step
